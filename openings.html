<p>I am currently accepting researchers interested in performing world-class research in situational awareness and applied ocean sciences. My group fosters an exciting and collaborative research environment, in which students experience both practical and theoretical research problems. Interested candidates should have a strong background in statistical signal processing, multiobject tracking, data fusion, machine learning, and/or marine robotics. Students and fellows should be inquisitive, independent thinkers who are dedicated to solving the hardest problems and communicating their solutions to the broader group and community. Accepted UC San Diego students (MSc and PhD), visiting students, and postdoctoral fellows are welcome to contact me for more information.  </p>
<p>Please submit your detailed resume (incl. statement of purpose, research interests and possibly a list of relevant publications) to <a href="mailto:flmeyer@ucsd.edu">flmeyer@ucsd.edu</a></p>
